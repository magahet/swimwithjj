        <p class="flow-text"><strong class="red-text text-lighten-2">Always a fish myself</strong>, it was only natural that I chose to be on a swim team because that meant I could swim year round!  And, since I loved being in the water so much and also loved kids, it was a logical decision to start teaching swim lessons at the age of 13.</p>

        <p class="flow-text">Since then, whether it was during high school at Crescenta Valley, as an undergraduate student at UCLA, earning a Master's of Arts in Education from Pepperdine, or teaching in my own classroom, I have always looked forward to my summers of helping both children and adults become <strong class="red-text text-lighten-2">not only water safe, but also proficient swimmers.</strong></p>

        <p class="flow-text">My goal first and foremost is to teach individuals of all ages to be completely safe and comfortable in the water.  My second goal is to <strong class="red-text text-lighten-2">make swimming a fun activity</strong>.  Lastly, I want all of my students to become life-long swimmers by learning different strokes, breathing on the side, diving, and even flip turns!</p>

        <p class="flow-text">I look forward to working with you and your children this summer!</p>
