				<strong class="text-maroon">Always a fish myself</strong>, it was only
				natural that I chose to be on a swim team because that meant I could
				swim year round! And, since I loved being in the water so much and
				also loved kids, it was a logical decision to start teaching swim
				lessons at the age of 13.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since then, whether it was during high school, playing water polo for
				UCLA, earning a Master's of Arts in Education from Pepperdine,
				teaching in my own classroom, or now, homeschooling my own children, I
				have always looked forward to my summers of helping both children and
				adults become
				<strong class="text-maroon">
					not only water safe, but also proficient swimmers.
				</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				My goal first and foremost is to teach individuals of all ages to be
				completely safe and comfortable in the water. My second goal is to
				<strong class="text-maroon">make swimming a fun activity</strong>.
				Lastly, I want all of my students to become life-long swimmers by
				learning different strokes, breathing on the side, diving, and even
				flip turns!
			</p>

			<p>I look forward to working with you and your children this summer!</p>
