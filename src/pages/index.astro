				<p>The primary focus for each class is <strong class="text-maroon">water safety</strong>. The water should be a place to have fun and be playful, but staying afloat is the first priority. JJ teaches her students <strong class="text-maroon">not to rely on swimming aids</strong> or help from others. Kids are taught to stay calm if they fall into the water, how to float on their own, and how to get back to the wall.</p>

				<h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Small Group Learning</h2>
				<p>Lessons are made up of <strong class="text-maroon">2 to 4 students</strong> at the same level of swimming proficiency. The groups are small enough that each child receives <strong class="text-maroon">personalized instruction</strong>. At the same time, the group setting allows kids to learn from watching others and to receive <strong class="text-maroon">positive reinforcement</strong> from their peers.</p>

				<p>Anxiety around the water is a normal reaction. However, many of JJ's swimmers develop an <strong class="text-maroon">excitement and confidence</strong> in their abilities that surprises and inspires them. JJ finds the <strong class="text-maroon">balance between empathy and firmness</strong> that empowers her students to abandon their fears and learn to love the water.</p>
